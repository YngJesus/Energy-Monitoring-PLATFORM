That sounds like a solid plan for your PFE project, Baha! Keeping it simple yet effective is a great approach. Adding peak usage tracking is an excellent idea too, as it helps users understand when their energy consumption is highest, which can be crucial for managing and reducing their energy bills. Here's a more detailed breakdown of what you can include:

Key Metrics to Display
Total Energy Consumption:

Daily, Weekly, Monthly Views: Show the total energy consumed in kWh over different periods. Use line graphs or bar charts to visualize this data, helping users identify trends and patterns.
Cost of Consumption:

Real-Time Cost Calculation: Calculate the cost based on the current electricity rate (e.g., 0.22 TND per kWh).
Cost Display: Show the cost alongside the consumption data for the same periods (daily, weekly, monthly). This can be a simple table or integrated into the graphs.
Comparing Devices:

Device Selection: Allow users to select two or more devices from a list.
Comparison Visualization: Use side-by-side bar charts or multi-line graphs to compare the energy consumption and cost of the selected devices. Highlight the differences clearly.
Peak Usage:

Peak Usage Identification: Track and display the times of day when energy usage is highest. This can be visualized with a 24-hour bar chart or heatmap.
Alerts for Peak Usage: Optionally, provide alerts or notifications when peak usage times are detected, helping users take immediate action to reduce consumption.
Implementation Ideas
Simple Dashboard Layout:

Main Display: A clean, simple interface with tabs or sections for each key metric.
Graphs and Charts: Use libraries like Chart.js or D3.js for interactive and visually appealing data visualization.
Energy Consumption and Cost Calculation:

Backend Processing: Calculate total energy consumption and cost on the server-side and send this data to the front-end.
Real-Time Updates: If possible, implement real-time updates using websockets or periodic API calls to keep the data fresh.
User Interaction:

Device Comparison: Provide dropdown menus or checkboxes for users to select devices they want to compare.
Date Range Selection: Allow users to select custom date ranges for viewing energy consumption and cost data.
Peak Usage Visualization:

Heatmap or Bar Chart: Use a heatmap to show peak usage times across different hours of the day, or a bar chart to highlight the highest usage periods.
Tooltips and Details: Implement tooltips on graphs to show detailed information about usage at specific times.
Example Workflow
User Logs In: The user accesses the dashboard.
Dashboard Overview: The main screen displays a summary of total energy consumption and cost for the current day, week, and month.
Detailed Views:
Energy Consumption Tab: Shows a detailed graph of energy usage over selected periods.
Cost Tab: Displays the corresponding cost data.
Device Comparison: The user selects devices to compare, and a comparison chart is displayed.
Peak Usage Tab: Shows peak usage times in a 24-hour heatmap or bar chart.
Alerts and Tips: Optional section for alerts on high usage and tips for reducing consumption.
Keeping It Simple
Focus on Core Features: Only implement the most critical features to ensure the project stays manageable.
User-Friendly Design: Prioritize a clean and intuitive interface.
Responsive Design: Ensure the dashboard works well on various devices, including desktops and mobiles.
By focusing on these key areas and keeping the design simple yet informative, you'll create a useful and user-friendly energy monitoring dashboard that meets the needs of your project without becoming overly complex. If you need more specific guidance or have further questions, feel free to ask!
